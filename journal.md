I setup the public github repo for this, using my 2022 entry as a starting
point, and stripped it down to a skeleton framework. I'm unsure if I'll be
using the LittleJS this time around, as I still don't know what I'll be
making, so no engine yet either. But it builds!

Still thinking of a game idea though. Really leaning into the 13 steps idea,
or even converting it into something like "only 13 jumps". But still unsure
of a game as a whole.

I'm going to try to journal the journey of this competition this time around
so I'm not purely dependent on memory for the post-mortem.

I was away from home when this competition, and will be be for another week,
but I still started to think of some game ideas so I can hit the ground
running.

Here are some ideas I started with:

- Only 13 tries or steps (game gets more intense the more tries)
- Skip every 13th step
- must hide or not move on the 13th hour (1 pm on a clock?)

Leaning towards the 13 tries or the 13th hour idea.
